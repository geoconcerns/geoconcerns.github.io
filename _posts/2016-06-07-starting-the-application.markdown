## Starting the application
  1. Vagrant instructions (skip if the VM was started in part 3)
  1. Start Solr, Fedora, and Rails
  1. Create a new user


### Vagrant instructions

1. If another vagrant box is running, it needs to be stopped first.

   ```sh
   $ vagrant halt
   ```

1. Navigate to the geo-concerns vagrant directory and start the machine.

   ```sh
   $ cd ../geo-concerns-vagrant
   $ vagrant up
   ```

1. Navigate to the geo-concerns vagrant directory and start the machine.

   ```sh
   $ cd ../geo-concerns-vagrant
   $ vagrant up
   ```

1. SSH into the VM

   Mac and Linux

   ```sh
   $ vagrant ssh
   ```

   Windows

   ```
   Use PuTTY
   ```

### Start Solr, Fedora, and Rails

After logging into the server and navigating to the geo concerns demo directory, you will need to start the various servers necessary to run the application. A special `rake` command was created to do this in one step.

```sh
$ cd geo-concerns-demo
$ rake demo:servers 
```

You can now navigate to the web pages for each of the services we just started. It might be useful to open a new browser tab for each service.

- [Demo App](http://127.0.0.1:3000)
- [Fedora](http://127.0.0.1:8984)
- [Solr](http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr)

### Create a new user

Since this is a brand new application, we have to create a user in order to continue.

1. Open the demo app link in a browser tab.
1. Click on **Log in** in the upper right-hand corner.
1. Click on the **Sign up** link direcly below the **Log in** button.
1. Add an email address (can be fake) and a password. `123456` works fine.

1. Click on the **Sign up** button and you're in!
