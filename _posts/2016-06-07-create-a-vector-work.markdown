## Create a vector work
  1. What's a vector work?
  1. Create the vector work
  1. Attach a shapefile
  1. Attach an external metadata file
  1. Build a Geoblacklight Solr document

### What's a vector work?

A vector work represents a geospatial vector dataset. Points, lines, polygons. Common formats include the shapefile and GeoJSON. In this case, the vector work represents the output of a feature extraction process that was run on the parent raster work.

### Create the vector work

1. On the show page of your Raster Work, create a child Vector Work.
1. Click **Attach Child** and select **Attach Vector Work**
1. On the new vector work form add a basic **Title** and fill in the **Provenance** field.

1. Click **Create Vector Work**.

### Attach a shapefile

1. Attach a vector file to the work using the same process as the other works.
1. This time the **Type** should be **ESRI Shapefile**.
1. The file can be found at **McKay** / **Geospatial_Data** / **S_566_1914_lines.zip**

   ![shapefile_path](/images/shapefile_path.png)

1. The shapefile is now attached to the vector work.

   In GeoConcerns, file formats that are composed of multiple files (as in the Shapefile) must be  zipped into a single file before uploading.

### Attach an external metadata file

1. Now, attach an FGDC external metadata to the work.
1. The file can be found at **McKay** / **Geospatial_Data** / **S_566_1914_lines_fgdc.xml**

1. Once the file is attached, use it to populate the vector work attributes like you did with the raster work.

### Build a Geoblacklight Solr document

GeoConcerns has the ability to generate documents for use in external discovery systems like Geoblacklight.

1. In the address bar for the vector work, append `/geoblacklight` to the end of the URL.

1. The application will build a JSON formatted document that can be indexed into a Geoblacklight Solr instance.
