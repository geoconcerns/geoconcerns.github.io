### What is a collection?

```
"Anything you want it to be." 
- Jon Stroop
```

In Hydra/PCDM, a collection is an arbitrary grouping of resources to use how you see fit. In the previous steps, we created an image work for a scanned map and a child raster work for a georectified version of that map. Perhaps we are just starting the process of digitizing and preserving a set of related maps. We can use a collection to group these objects together.

### Make a collection

1. Click the **+** symbol in the upper-right corner.
1. Select **Add a Collection** from the drop-down menu.

   ![add_collection](/images/add_collection.png)
1. Fill out fields on the **Create New Collection** form. Only the *Title* field is required.

   ![collection_form](/images/collection_form.png)
1. Click the **Create Collection** button at the bottom of the page.
1. You've now created your first collection!

### Add items to the collection
1. On the Collection show page, click **Add file from your dashboard**
1. Find the **Select an action** button next to your raster work.
1. Select **Add to a Collection**

1. Select your new collection from the drop-down menu on the dialog box.

   ![select_collection](/images/select_collection.png)

1. The raster work is now part of the collection.
